# Blog API Integration

This is a CRUD API for a blogging platform with 
integration testing added.

## Requirements

Revisit the blogging app created at the end of the previous lesson.

Add integration tests for all four of the API endpoints. Configure continuous integration so that TravisCI runs the tests each time changes are pushed to GitHub, and the app deploys to Heroku any time pushes and merges to master happen and the tests pass.
